## Projects
### Plant Trait Prediction
[Project Link](https://github.com/YumengggZhang/Plan-Trait-Prediction)
This project aims to predict six plant traits, like leaf area and plant height, using crowd-sourced images and additional data. Given the variability in citizen science data, achieving high accuracy for these traits, which reflect chemical tissue properties, may be challenging. The goal is to investigate the feasibility of this method and understand global ecosystem changes. We will use a multi-task learning model to predict multiple traits from photos, allowing us to identify inter-trait relationships and possibly improve performance.

### Hotel Cancellation Rate Prediction

The project focused on developing a predictive model for hotel cancellation rates, encompassing detailed data analysis and feature engineering to discern user behavior patterns. Tools such as scatter plots and heatmaps were instrumental in comparing churned and active customers. Advanced machine learning models, including Random Forest and Boosting algorithms, were implemented and fine-tuned. The culmination of these efforts was a highly accurate model, achieving a 99.6% success rate, which highlighted the project's contribution to enhancing customer retention strategies in the hospitality industry.

### Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Segmentation
[Project Link](https://github.com/YumengggZhang/Few-Shot-Learning-CV)

The project involved guiding a team of three in developing a robust codebase for a semi-supervised few-shot segmentation task using PyTorch. The team successfully created over 2000+ lines of code, managed through Git, which facilitated experimentation with various feature extractors and segmentation heads. A key part of the project was exploring GPT-based architectures like Dino2 and DeiT for few-shot segmentation. This exploration revealed the exceptional generalization capability of Dino2, which achieved a notable 0.5 mean IOU (Intersection Over Union) with just a single training sample. This performance notably outshined all other segmentation models tested in the project, demonstrating the potential of GPT-based architectures in advancing the field of few-shot segmentation.

### Few-shot learning in Image Classification
[Project Link](https://github.com/YumengggZhang/Few-Shot-Learning-CV)

The project involved an innovative integration of a self-supervised learning task into a Few-Shot learning pipeline, employing the Prototypical Network framework within PyTorch. This strategic integration significantly boosted classification accuracy, elevating it from 65.6% to 71.9% on the ImageNet dataset. Further enhancing the model's capabilities, an additional feature extractor specifically tailored for self-supervision tasks was developed. This augmentation involved using concatenated feature vectors for the final classification process, which was followed by a series of comparative experiments to validate the effectiveness of this approach. This advancement not only improved accuracy but also demonstrated the potential of combining self-supervised learning with Few-Shot learning techniques in image classification tasks.
